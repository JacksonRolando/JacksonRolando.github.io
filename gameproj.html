My group realized a common plight for MSOE students: a ton of coursework. To help relieve this burden, we decided on designing a productivity maximizer. This design process involved many important steps and deliverables. My team and I drew out numerous initial solutions, then once we decided on one, we drew several rough versions of what our UI could look like. We thought through our user flow and user journey, then after much deliberation, filtering and combining ideas, we reached a consensus on a design and then built our final wireframes in a program called Balsamiq. My role on the team involved a little bit of everything, both contributing ideas and producing some of the deliverables, also serving as the main leader. During our in-class meetings, I helped keep the group on track, was able to divide up the work into chunks that each individual could complete, and communicated often with the group to make sure everything went smoothly outside of class. </div> <div><img class="md:max-w-sm object-scale-down rounded-lg" src="/wireframe.3f443eeb.png"></div> </div> <div class="container md:max-w-5xl md:pb-0 mx-auto pb-5 px-10 text-justify"> This project was definitely a welcomed exercise in communication. I feel I excelled in the explanation of my own solutions while also listening to my team members’ great ideas, allowing us to efficiently focus in our ideas into one solid plan. I was also able to use my close attention to detail to make sure our diagrams and wireframes were readable and consistent. A big challenge initially was making sure every team member had a clear idea of what they needed to do. We solved that problem by putting a very clear to-do list in Microsoft Teams with names attached to various objectives, allowing everyone to see precisely what they were responsible for and to provide an easy way to communicate about those objectives. </div> <div class="container flex flex-col items-center md:flex-row md:max-w-5xl md:pb-0 mx-auto pb-5 px-5"> <div><img class="md:max-w-sm object-scale-down rounded-lg" src="/sketch.cd9d1a44.png"></div> <div class="md:px-5 md:py-0 p-5 text-justify"> This project taught me a lot about a design process I was completely unfamiliar with. I learned different strategies to brainstorm ideas and come to a decision, figured out effective ways to explain those ideas, and found new organizational techniques to streamline the realization of those ideas. This project also introduced me to wireframing, specifically in Balsamiq Wireframes. Wireframing is an easy way to bring a design out of your head and into format that can be shared, discussed, revised, and then implemented. Figuring out the nuances of Balsamiq was initially a challenge, but after some trial and error, I can say I’m not confident with the program. The design process explored through this project will be extremely helpful for my projects in the future. Not only will it help me come up with ideas and filter through them to find the best solution for a given problem, it’ll also help me document my processes in a way that can be presented to others. </div> </div> <div class="flex flex-wrap items-center justify-center md:mt-16 px-4"> <img class="m-2 md:max-w-sm object-scale-down rounded-lg" src="/user journey.e67df89d.png"> </div> </div> </body><br><br><br></html>
