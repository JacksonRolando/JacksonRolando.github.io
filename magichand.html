I’ve flashed cheap Chinese switches with new firmware, set up a smart home hub on my Raspberry Pi, and coded my own animations on individually addressable LEDs. Using Alexa to control my many devices is very convenient, but I wanted something cooler, something that felt a little more futuristic. The Magic Hand allows me to control the lights in my room with waves of my hand, making me feel like I’m in a Science-Fiction movie. This project allowed me to experiment with AI outside of my studies, applying it to achieve a personal goal. I am extremely interested in data science, so it was only logical to make an entire project out of it. I coded the microcontroller, trained the recurrent neural network, and loaded it onto said microcontroller, and received some help from a friend, Miles Oquendo, in designing the battery management system to make the device cordless. A lot went into this project, and the final product shows it. </div> <div><img class="md:max-w-sm object-scale-down rounded-lg" src="placeholderPurple.a18b44f7.png"></div> </div> <div class="container md:max-w-5xl md:pb-0 mx-auto pb-5 px-10 text-justify"> I was able to compile a wide range of my skills for this project: my background in coding with an object-oriented mindset to organize the many functions of the device, my experience parsing data into a more useful form to take in data for training, as well as my knowledge of machine learning to structure data and use a neural network to yield an accurate classification of each gesture. I was able to identify a problem that could utilize AI and applied it to create a robust solution. When getting into the project, I wasn’t sure where to start. </div> <div class="container flex flex-col items-center md:flex-row md:max-w-5xl md:pb-0 mx-auto pb-5 px-5"> <div><img class="md:max-w-sm object-scale-down rounded-lg" src="placeholderPurple.a18b44f7.png"></div> <div class="md:px-5 md:py-0 p-5 text-justify"> I had never used TensorFlow, nor had I loaded an AI model onto an Arduino via TensorFlow Lite. I hadn’t ever sent or received custom messages over Bluetooth. I had never had to think about power consumption on a battery-powered device. My work was cut out for me. Through this project, I was able to dive into these topics with the help of many google searches, official documentation, and YouTube tutorials. I now know how to use TensorFlow, an AI library I will be using for many years to come. I also gained valuable experience combining many complex concepts and methods into one program and product, a pattern used in all parts of the tech industry that I’ve had little prior experience in. Now that I have struggled through one AI-hardware project, I now know how not to initially set up my code. I’m sure I will create cool projects like this in the future, and the organization, readability, and documentation of those projects will be much better than this one. Now that I know what components need to be present for a project like this, I can better plan for them in my next project. </div> </div> <div class="flex flex-wrap items-center justify-center md:mt-16 px-4"> <img class="m-2 md:max-w-sm object-scale-down rounded-lg" src="placeholderPurple.a18b44f7.png"> <img class="m-2 md:max-w-sm object-scale-down rounded-lg" src="placeholderPurple.a18b44f7.png"> <img class="m-2 md:max-w-sm object-scale-down rounded-lg" src="placeholderPurple.a18b44f7.png"> </div> </div> </body><br><br><br></html>
